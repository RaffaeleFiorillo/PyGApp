# PyGApp
PyGApp is a very easy to use framework for the development of Apps and Software, using Python.
It is highly flexibile and very straighforward while also allowing for customizing the "look & feel" at a very low-level.

PyGApp brings the Pythonic way to do thing into the world of Software Development!
Allow yourself to achieve the result you WANT with the complexity you NEED.

Remember Python's motto: *"Weâ€™re all adults here"*. We are giving you this tool, and you have the freedom to do as you please with it.

# Features
 - Automatic Multiplatform Export: No need to waste time and energy trying to use external tools to export your Apps. PyGApp provides built-in mechanisms to export your code to .exe (Windows) and .app (Mac Os) applications;
 - Multiple Pre-Coded components and Widgets: You can use existing Buttons, Modals, Scrollables, Input-Boxes, Text-Boxes; Pop-ups; Special-Effects;...
 - Component and Widget Customization: You can customize existing elements to look and work the way you want;
 - Downloadable Templates: If you are only interested in creating something FAST, there is a(n evergrowing) list of templates ready for use so that you don't have to create one;
 - Built-in Game Development tools: PyGApp uses the pygame library, therefore, has access to all its features and also implements some new (excellent) ones;

# Why use PyGApp?
It is well known that there are currently a LOT of frameworks for the creation of software. 
Certainly most of them are more professional, provide more features and are better in a huge number of ways.
So, why would someone even have a look at PyGApp when there are literally tons of "better" frameworks?
To answer that question, we must first define what is "better". 

Certainly a framework that offers more features is better, right? Well... what if this framework is SUPER hard to use?

What if a framework has a good amount of features, it is relatively easy to use... buuuuuut you need to write 3000 lines of code to create a simple button?

You will quickly realise that there are many factors to consider when defining what is a "better framework".
To find the root of the matter, ask yourself this: "Would a framework be good if it is perfect in every way EXCEPT for what you need?" And, of course, the answer would be "No".
At the end of the day the "best framework" only exists relative to your needs.
What are your needs? How does PyGApp respond to those needs?

## Pros & Cons
Let's explore where and how PyGApp shines, and how to decide if it's really the right choice for you.

#### Note: 
There is a reason why Python is not the main programming language chosen for Software Development: It's not very fast.
Before you explore your possibilities inside the "Python Software Development Frameroks" you should first ensure that "Python" is really what you want.

### Pros
 - Built-in Multiplatform Export: There are built in features to convert your code to .exe files (Windows) or .app (Mac) without the need to use external tools;
 - Very Easy to Master: It provides a solid, diverse and complete base for a variety of cenarios, but leaves the freedom of the more complex implementations to the developer;
 - Light Weight: The framework by itself does not occupy more than 60Kb (It can go higher, but only if the developer chooses to import additional templates);
 - Minimal Verbosity and Boilerplate Code: The code is very straightforward and requires a relatively small amount of code to produce results;
 - Low Level Control: As a developer, you have control to every small detail and aspect of the Application's development and visual elements;
 - Clear Architecture: The software architecture to be used is strongly hinted by the framework. However, it is not something set in stone. The developer can choose to change it
 - Consequential Complexity: The development is always easy at the beginning. The complexity in the development process is a direct consequence of the complexity of the Application being developed. It only gets as difficult as the developer can manage;
 - Direct Access to Base Code: Unlike other frameworks (which discourage you to "mess arround") PyGApp gives you access to all the framework's code and encourages you to do as you please.
 - Perfect for Game Development: The whole PyGApp framework was built around the pygame library as a form to have a starting point to start creating games fast instead of always start from scratch;

### Cons
 - Complex Resizable Window Management: At the moment, creating Apps and Software with resizable windows is very hard to manage. It must be done from scratch. Including widget position and size responsiveness;
 - Encouraged Pygame Knowlege: Since PyGApp is based on the pygame library, without any knowlege about this library could make it harder to develop more nuanced aspects of the Applications;


# Demos:
Let's see some great examples of Applications created using the PyGApp framework:

## [APPythonix](https://github.com/RaffaeleFiorillo/APPythonix)
A tool designed to convert Python scripts to .exe files (Windows) or .app (Mac). It comes with a simple, compact and modern looking GUI.

## [Fast and Curious](https://github.com/RaffaeleFiorillo/Fast_and_Curious) 
A game to learn/improve keyboard typing skills while also learning fun facts and study a specific subject.
The player controls a moving car that avoids enemies and obstacles, by typing on the keyboard.
The car speed is related to the player's typing speed. The car's ability to avoid obstacles is related to the player's typing precision.
